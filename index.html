            <h1>The Farnsworth Parabox</h1>
                <p>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Pansy. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</p>
            <h2>Less Than Hero</h2>
            <p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Belligerent and numerous.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Also Zoidberg.</li>
                <li>Pansy.</li>
                <li>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</li>
                <li>Why would a robot need to drink?</li>

            <h3>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
            <h4>A Tale of Two Santas</h4>
                <p>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! No argument here. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</li>
                <li>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>The Day The Earth Stood Stupid</h5>
                <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!  I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it&hellip; then perhaps gifts! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
